for each measured point, right pt. ,and left pt. set left measurement as origin
rotate the LR, LM points at the angle they make [1,0,0] vector.
fit 3 measurements equation: z = Ax(x-B),
here: B = norm(LR), A = z/x(x-B)
predict the model for asked linspace
rotate back the vector
shift L pt to its original point and the all others so
