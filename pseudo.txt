****CROSS SECT MODEL FIT****
for each measured point, right pt. ,and left pt. set left measurement as origin
rotate the LR, LM points at the angle they make [1,0,0] vector.
fit 3 measurements equation: z = Ax(x-B),
here: B = norm(LR), A = z/x(x-B)
predict the model for asked linspace
rotate back the vector
shift L pt to its original point and the all others so

***VERTICAL INTERPOLATION***

there are 30 measurements
overall_pred -> (1770,3)
each batch = 59## for each cross section i've 59 data
#number of data generated of each cs -> 2*division-1 ##@line116 it is defined
